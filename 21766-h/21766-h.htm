      NOTE
    </h2>
    <p>
      William Johnson published in 1858 a slender volume bound in green cloth,
      (Smith, Elder &amp; Co.) which was entitled "Ionica," and which comprised
      forty-eight poems.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1877 he printed privately a little paper-covered book (Cambridge
      University Press), entitled "Ionica II," containing twenty-five poems.
      This book is a rare bibliographical curiosity. It has neither titlepage
      nor index; it bears no author's name; and it is printed without
      punctuation, on a theory of the author's, spaces being left, instead of
      stops, to indicate pauses.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1891 he published a book, "Ionica" (George Allen), which contained most
      of the contents of the two previous volumes, together with some pieces not
      previously published&mdash;eighty-five poems in all.
    </p>
    <p>
      The present volume is a reprint of the 1891 volume; but it has been
      thought well to include, in an appendix, certain of the poems which
      appeared in one or other of the first two issues, but were omitted from
      the 1891 issue, together with a little Greek lyric, with its English
      equivalent, from the "Letters and Journals."
    </p>
    <p>
      The poems from page 1 to page 104, Desiderato to All that was possible,
      appeared in the 1858 volume, together with those on pages 211 to 216, To
      the Infallible, The Swimmer's Wish, and An Apology. The poems from page
      105 to page 162, Scheveningen Avenue to L'Oiseau Bleu, appeared in the
      1877 volume, together with those on pages 217 and 218, Notre Dame and In
      Honour of Matthew Prior. The remainder of the poems, from page 163 to page
      210, appeared in the 1891 volume for the first time. The dates subjoined
      to the poems are those which he himself added, and indicate the date of
      composition.

    <h2>
      INTRODUCTION
    </h2>
    <p>
      WILLIAM CORY (Johnson) was born at Torrington in Devonshire, on January 9,
      1823. He was the son of Charles William Johnson, a merchant, who retired
      at the early age of thirty, with a modest competence, and married his
      cousin, Theresa Furse, of Halsdon, near Torrington, to whom he had long
      been attached. He lived a quiet, upright, peaceable life at Torrington,
      content with little, and discharging simple, kindly, neighbourly duties,
      alike removed from ambition and indolence. William Cory had always a deep
      love of his old home, a strong sense of local sanctities and tender
      associations. "I hope you will always feel," his mother used to say,
      "wherever you live, that Torrington belongs to you." He said himself, in
      later years, "I want to be a Devon man and a Torrington man." His memory
      lingered over the vine-shaded verandah, the jessamine that grew by the
      balustrade of the steps, the broad-leaved myrtle that covered the wall of
      the little yard.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy was elected on the foundation at Eton in 1832, little guessing
      that it was to be his home for forty years. He worked hard at school,
      became a first-rate classical scholar, winning the Newcastle Scholarship
      in 1841, and being elected Scholar of King's in 1842. He seems to have
      been a quiet, retiring boy, with few intimate friends, respected for his
      ability and his courtesy, living a self-contained, bookish life, yet with
      a keen sense of school patriotism&mdash;though he had few pleasant
      memories of his boyhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Honours came to him fast at Cambridge. He won the Chancellor's English
      Medal with a poem on Plato in 1843, the Craven Scholarship in 1844. In
      those days Kingsmen did not enter for the Tripos, but received a degree,
      without examination, by ancient privilege. He succeeded to a Fellowship in
      1845, and in the same year was appointed to a Mastership at Eton by Dr.
      Hawtrey. At Cambridge he seems to have read widely, to have thought much,
      and to have been interested in social questions. Till that time he had
      been an unreflecting Tory and a strong High Churchman, but he now adopted
      more Liberal principles, and for the rest of his life was a convinced
      Whig. The underlying principle of Whiggism, as he understood it, was a
      firm faith in human reason. Thus, in a letter of 1875, he represents the
      Whigs as saying to their adversaries, "You are in a majority now: if I
      were an ultra-democrat or counter of noses, I should submit to you as
      having a transcendental &mdash;sometimes called divine&mdash;right; if I
      were a redcap, I should buy dynamite and blow you up; if I were a Tory, I
      should go to church or to bed; as it is, I go to work to turn your
      majority into a minority. I shall do it by reasoning and by attractive
      virtue." He intended in his university days, and for some time after, to
      take Anglican Orders, though he had also some thought of going to the Bar;
      but he accepted a Mastership with much relief, with the hope, as he wrote
      in an early letter, "that before my time is out, I may rejoice in having
      turned out of my pupil-room perhaps one brave soldier, or one wise
      historian, or one generous legislator, or one patient missionary." The
      whole of his professional life, a period of twenty-seven years, was to be
      spent at Eton.

    <p>
      No one who knew William Cory will think it an exaggeration to say that his
      mind was probably one of the most vigorous and commanding minds of the
      century. He had a mental equipment of the foremost order, great
      intellectual curiosity, immense vigour and many-sidedness, combined with a
      firm grasp of a subject, perfect clearness of thought, and absolute
      lucidity of expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      He never lost sight of principles among a crowd of details; and though he
      had a strong bias in certain directions, he had a just and catholic
      appreciation even of facts which told against his case. Yet his knowledge
      was never dry or cold; it was full to the brim of deep sentiment and
      natural feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had a wide knowledge of history, of politics, both home and foreign, of
      political economy, of moral science. Indeed, he examined more than once in
      the Moral Science Tripos at Cambridge.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had a thorough acquaintance with and a deep love of literature; and all
      this in spite of the fact that he lived a very laborious and wearing life
      as a school-teacher, with impossibly large classes, and devoted himself
      with whole-hearted enthusiasm to his profession. His knowledge was,
      moreover, not mere erudition and patient accumulation. It was all ready
      for use, and at his fingers' ends. Moreover, he combined with this a
      quality, which is not generally found in combination with the
      highly-developed faculties of the doctrinaire, namely an intense and
      fervent emotion. He was a lover of political and social liberty, a patriot
      to the marrow of his bones; he loved his country with a passionate
      devotion, and worshipped the heroes of his native land, statesmen,
      soldiers, sailors, poets, with an ardent adoration; the glory and honour
      of England were the breath of his nostrils. Deeds of heroism, examples of
      high courage and noble self-sacrifice, were the memories that thrilled his
      heart. As a man of fifty he wept over Lanfrey's account of Nelson's death;
      he felt our defeat at Majuba Hill like a keen personal humiliation; his
      letter on the subject is as the words of one mourning for his mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      But his was not a mere poetical emotion, supplying him with
      highly-coloured rhetoric, or sentimental panegyric. He had a technical and
      minute acquaintance with the detailed movement of wars, the precise ships
      and regiments engaged, the personalities and characters of commanders and
      officers, the conduct of the rank and file.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many delightful stories remain in the memories of his friends and hearers
      to attest this. His pupil-room at Eton, in what was formerly the old
      Christopher Inn, was close to the street, and the passage of the Guards
      through Eton, to and from their Windsor quarters, is an incident of
      constant occurrence. When the stately military music was heard far off, in
      gusty splendour, in the little town, or the fifes and drums of some
      detachment swept blithely past, he would throw down his pen and go down
      the little staircase to the road, the boys crowding round him. "Brats, the
      British army!" he would say, and stand, looking and listening, his eyes
      filled with gathering tears, and his heart full of proud memories, while
      the rhythmical beat of the footsteps went briskly echoing by.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again, he went down to Portsmouth to see a friend who was in command of a
      man-of-war; he was rowed about among the hulks; the sailors in the gig
      looked half contemptuously at the sturdy landsman, huddled in a cloak,
      hunched up in the stem-sheets, peering about through his spectacles. But
      contempt became first astonishment, and then bewildered admiration, when
      they found that he knew the position of every ship, and the engagements in
      which each had fought.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was of course a man of strong preferences and prejudices; he thought of
      statesmen and patriots, such as Pitt, Nelson, Castlereagh, Melbourne, and
      Wellington, with an almost personal affection. The one title to his
      vehement love was that a man should have served his country, striven to
      enhance her greatness, extended her empire, and safeguarded her liberty.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the same with his feeling for authors. He loved Virgil as a friend;
      he almost worshipped Charlotte BrontÃ«. He spoke of Tennyson as "the light
      and joy of my poor life." In 1868 he saw Sir W. Scott's portrait in
      London, and wrote: "Sir Walter Scott, shrewd yet wistful, boyish yet dry,
      looking as if he would ask and answer questions of the fairies&mdash;him I
      saw through a mist of weeping. He is my lost childhood, he is my first
      great friend. I long for him, and hate the death that parts us."
    </p>
    <p>
      In literature, the first claim on his regard was that a writer should have
      looked on life with a high-hearted, generous gaze, should have cared
      intensely for humanity, should have hoped, loved, suffered, not in selfish
      isolation, but with eager affection. Thus he was not only a philosophical
      historian, nor a mere technical critic; he was for ever dominated by an
      intense personal fervour. He cared little for the manner of saying a
      thing, so long as the heart spoke out frankly and freely; he strove to
      discern the energy of the soul in all men; he could forgive everything
      except meanness, cowardice, egotism and conceit; there was no fault of a
      generous and impulsive nature that he could not condone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus he was for many boys a deeply inspiring teacher; he had the art of
      awakening enthusiasm, of investing all he touched with a mysterious charm,
      the charm of wide and accurate knowledge illuminated by feeling and
      emotion. He rebuked ignorance in a way which communicated the desire to
      know. There are many men alive who trace the fruit and flower of their
      intellectual life to his generous and free-handed sowing. But in spite of
      the fact that the work of a teacher of boys was intensely congenial to
      him, that he loved generous boyhood, and tender souls, and awakening minds
      with all his heart, he was not wholly in the right place as an instructor
      of youth. With all his sympathy for what was weak and immature, he was yet
      impatient of dullness, of stupidity, of caution; much that he said was too
      mature, too exalted for the cramped and limited minds of boyhood. He was
      sensitive to the charm of eager, high-spirited, and affectionate natures,
      but he had also the equable, just, paternal interest in boys which is an
      essential quality in a wise schoolmaster. Yet he was apt to make
      favourites; and though he demanded of his chosen pupils and friends a high
      intellectual zeal, though he was merciless to all sloppiness and lack of
      interest, yet he forfeited a wider influence by his reputation for
      partiality, and by an obvious susceptibility to grace of manner and
      unaffected courtesy. Boys who did not understand him, and whom he did not
      care to try to understand, thought him simply fanciful and eccentric. It
      is perhaps to be regretted that unforeseen difficulties prevented his
      being elected Tutor of his old College, and still more that in 1860 he was
      passed over in favour of Kingsley, when the Prime Minister, Lord
      Palmerston, submitted his name to the Queen for the Professorship of
      Modern History at Cambridge. Four men were suggested, of whom Blakesley
      and Venables refused the post. Sir Arthur Helps was set aside, and it
      would have been offered to Johnson, if the Prince Consort had not
      suggested Kingsley. Yet Johnson would hardly have been in his right place
      as a teacher of young men. He would have been, on the one hand, brought
      into contact with more vigorous and independent minds, capable of
      appreciating the force and width of his teaching, and of comprehending the
      quality and beauty of his enthusiasms. But, on the other hand, he was too
      impatient of any difference of opinion, and, though he loved equal talk,
      he hated argument. And after all, he did a great work at Eton; for nearly
      a quarter of a century he sent out boys who cared eagerly and generously
      for the things of the mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      A second attempt was made, in 1869, to get him appointed to the history
      professorship, but Seeley was considered to have a better claim. Writing
      to a friend on the subject, Johnson said: "I am not learned. I don't care
      about history in the common meaning of the word."
    </p>
    <p>
      It is astonishing to see in his Diaries the immense trouble he took to
      awaken interest among his pupils. He was for ever trying experiments; he
      would read a dozen books to enable him to give a little scientific
      lecture, for he was one of the first to appreciate the educational value
      of science; he spent money on chemical apparatus, and tried to interest
      the boys by simple demonstrations. His educational ideals can best be seen
      in an essay full of poetical genius, on the education of the reasoning
      faculties, which he contributed to the "Essays on a Liberal Education,"
      edited in 1867 by F. W. Farrar. Any one who wishes to understand Johnson's
      point of view, should study this brilliant and beautiful discourse. It is
      not only wise and liberal, but it is intensely practical, besides
      containing a number of suggestive and poetical thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      He loved his Eton life more and more every year. As with Eumelus of
      Corinth, "dear to his heart was the muse that has the simple lyre and the
      sandals of freedom." He took refuge, as it became clear to him that his
      wider ambitions could not be realised, that he would not set the mark he
      might have set upon the age, in a "proud unworldliness," in heightened and
      intensified emotion. He made many friendships. He taught, as the years
      went on, as well or better than ever; he took great delight in the society
      of a few pupils and younger colleagues; but a shadow fell on him; he began
      to feel his strength unequal to the demands upon it; and he made a sudden
      resolution to retire from his Eton work.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had taken some years before, as a house for his holidays, Halsdon, a
      country place near his native Torrington, which belonged to his brother,
      Archdeacon Wellington Furse of Westminster, who had changed his name from
      Johnson to Furse, on succeeding to the property of an uncle. Here he
      retired, and strove to live an active and philosophical life, fighting
      bravely with regret, and feeling with sensitive sorrow the turning of the
      sweet page. He tried, too, to serve and help his simple country
      neighbours, as indeed he had desired to do even at Eton, by showing them
      many small, thoughtful, and unobtrusive kindnesses, just as his father had
      done. But he lived much, like all poetical natures, in tender retrospect;
      and the ending of the bright days brought with it a heartache that even
      nature, which he worshipped like a poet, was powerless to console. But he
      loved his woods and sloping fields, and the clear river passing under its
      high banks through deep pools. It served to remind him sadly of his
      beloved Thames, the green banks fringed with comfrey and loosestrife, the
      drooping willows, the cool smell of the weedy weir; of glad hours of
      light-hearted enjoyment with his boy-companions, full of blithe gaiety and
      laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a few years, he went out to Madeira, where he married a wife much
      younger than himself, Miss Rosa Caroline Guille, daughter of a Devonshire
      clergyman; and at Madeira his only son was born, whom he named Andrew,
      because it was a name never borne by a Pope, or, as he sometimes said, "by
      a sneak." He devoted himself at this time to the composition of two
      volumes of a "Guide to Modern English History." But his want of practice
      in historical writing is here revealed, though it must be borne in mind
      that it was originally drawn up for the use of a Japanese student. The
      book is full of acute perceptions, fine judgments, felicitous epigrams&mdash;but
      it is too allusive, too fantastic; neither has it the balance and justice
      required for so serious and comprehensive a task. At the same time the
      learning it displays is extraordinary. It was written almost without books
      of reference, and out of the recollections of a man of genius, who
      remembered all that he read, and considered reading the newspaper to be
      one of the first duties of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cory's other writings are few. Two little educational books are worth
      mentioning: a book of Latin prose exercises, called <i>Nuces</i>, the
      sentences of which are full of recondite allusions, curious humour, and
      epigrammatic expression; and a slender volume for teaching Latin lyrics,
      called <i>Lucretilis</i>, the exercises being literally translated from
      the Latin originals which he first composed. <i>Lucretilis</i> is not
      only, as Munro said, the most Horatian verse ever written since Horace,
      but full of deep and pathetic poetry. Such a poem as No. xxvii., recording
      the abandoning of Hercules by the Argonauts, is intensely
      autobiographical. He speaks, in a parable, of the life of Eton going on
      without him, and of his faith in her great future:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 "sed Argo
 Vela facit tamen, aureumque

 "Vellus petendum est. Tiphys ad hoc tenet
 Clavum magister; stat Telamon vigil,
 Stat Castor in prora, paratus
 Ferre maris salientis ictus."
</pre>
    <p>
      After some years in Madeira, he came back to England and settled in
      Hampstead; his later days were clouded with anxieties and illness. But he
      took great delight in the teaching of Greek to a class of girls, and his
      attitude of noble resignation, tender dignity, and resolute interest in
      the growing history of his race and nation is deeply impressive. He died
      in 1892, on June II, of a heart-complaint to which he had long been
      subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      In person William Cory was short and sturdy; he was strong and vigorous;
      he was like the leader whom Archilochus desired, "one who is compact of
      frame, showing legs that bend outward, standing firm upon his feet, full
      of courage." He had a vigorous, massive head, with aquiline nose, and
      mobile lips. He was extraordinarily near-sighted, and used strong glasses,
      holding his book close to his eyes. He was accustomed to bewail his
      limited vision, as hiding from him much natural beauty, much human drama;
      but he observed more closely than many men of greater clearness of sight,
      making the most of his limited resources. He depended much upon a hearing
      which was preternaturally acute and sensitive, and was guided as much by
      the voice and manner, as by the aspect of those among whom he lived. He
      had a brisk, peremptory mode of address, full of humorous mannerisms of
      speech. He spoke and taught crisply and decisively, and uttered fine and
      feeling thoughts with a telling brevity. He had strong common sense, and
      much practical judgment.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was intensely loyal both to institutions and friends, but never spared
      trenchant and luminous criticisms, and had a keen eye for weakness in any
      shape. He was formidable in a sense, though truly lovable; he had neither
      time nor inclination to make enemies, and had a generous perception of
      nobility of character, and of enthusiasms however dissimilar to his own.
      He hankered often for the wider world; he would have liked to have a hand
      in politics, and to have helped to make history. He often desired to play
      a larger part; but the very stirrings of regret only made him throw
      himself with intensified energy into the work of his life. He lived
      habitually on a higher plane than others, among the memories of great
      events, with a consciousness of high impersonal forces, great issues, big
      affairs; and yet he held on with both hands to life; he loved all that was
      tender and beautiful. He never lost himself in ambitious dreams or
      abstract speculations. He was a psychologist rather than a philosopher,
      and his interest and zest in life, in the relationships of simple people,
      the intermingling of personal emotions and happy comradeships, kept him
      from ever forming cynical or merely spectatorial views of humanity. He
      would have been far happier, indeed, if he could have practised a greater
      detachment; but, as it was, he gathered in, like the old warrior, a
      hundred spears; like Shelley he might have said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "I fall upon the thorns of life; I bleed."
    </p>
    <p>
      His is thus a unique personality, in its blending of intense mental energy
      with almost passionate emotions. Few natures can stand the strain of the
      excessive development of even a single faculty; and with William Cory the
      qualities of both heart and head were over-developed. There resulted a
      want of balance, of moral force; he was impetuous where he should have
      been calm, impulsive where he should have been discreet. But on the other
      hand he was possessed of an almost Spartan courage; and through sorrow and
      suffering, through disappointment and failure, he bore himself with a high
      and stately tenderness, without a touch of acrimony or peevishness. He
      never questioned the love or justice of God; he never raged against fate,
      or railed at circumstance. He gathered up the fragments with a quiet hand;
      he never betrayed envy or jealousy; he never deplored the fact that he had
      not realised his own possibilities; he suffered silently, he endured
      patiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      And thus he is a deeply pathetic figure, because his great gifts and high
      qualities never had full scope. He might have been a great jurist, a great
      lawyer, a great professor, a great writer, a great administrator; and he
      ended as a man of erratic genius, as a teacher in a restricted sphere,
      though sowing, generously and prodigally, rich and fruitful seed. With
      great poetical force of conception, and a style both resonant and
      suggestive, he left a single essay of high genius, a fantastic historical
      work, a few books of school exercises. A privately printed volume of
      Letters and Journals reveals the extraordinary quality of his mind, its
      delicacy, its beauty, its wistfulness, its charm. There remains but the
      little volume of verse which is here presented, which stands apart from
      the poetical literature of the age. We see in these poems a singular and
      original contribution to the poetry of the century. The verse is in its
      general characteristics of the school of Tennyson, with its equable
      progression, its honied epithets, its soft cadences, its gentle melody.
      But the poems are deeply original, because they, combine a peculiar
      classical quality, with a frank delight in the spirit of generous boyhood.
      For all their wealth of idealised sentiment, they never lose sight of the
      fuller life of the world that waits beyond the threshold of youth, the
      wider issues, the glory of the battle, the hopes of the patriot, the
      generous visions of manhood. They are full of the romance of boyish
      friendships, the echoes of the river and the cricket field, the ingenuous
      ambitions, the chivalry, the courage of youth and health, the brilliant
      charm of the opening world. These things are but the prelude to, the
      presage of, the energies of the larger stage; his young heroes are to
      learn the lessons of patriotism, of manliness, of activity, of generosity,
      that they may display them in a wider field. Thus he wrote in "A
      Retrospect of School Life":&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 "Much lost I; something stayed behind,
 A snatch, maybe, of ancient song.
 Some breathings of a deathless mind,
 Some love of truth, some hate of wrong.

 And to myself in games I said,
 'What mean the books? can I win fame
 I would be like the faithful dead,
 A fearless man, and pure of blame.'"
</pre>
    <p>
      Then, too, there are poems of a sombre yet tender philosophy, of an
      Epicureanism that is seldom languid, of a Stoicism that is never hard. In
      this world, where so much is dark, he seems to say, we must all clasp
      hands and move forwards, shoulder to shoulder, never forgetting the warm
      companionship in the presence of the blind chaotic forces that wave their
      shadowy wings about us. We must love what is near and dear, we must be
      courageous and tender-hearted in the difficult valley. The book is full of
      the passionate sadness of one who feels alike the intensity and the
      brevity of life, and who cannot conjecture why fair things must fade as
      surely as they bloom.
    </p>
    <p>
      The poems then reflect a kind of Platonic agnosticism; they offer no
      solution of the formless mystery; but they seem rather to indicate the
      hope that, in the multiplying of human relationship, in devotion to all we
      hold dear, in the enkindling of the soul by all that is generous and noble
      and unselfish, lies the best hope of the individual and of the race.
      Uncheered by Christian hopefulness, and yet strong in their belief in the
      ardours and passions of humanity, these poems may help us to remember and
      love the best of life, its days of sunshine and youth, its generous
      companionships, its sweet ties of loyalty and love, its brave hopes and
      ardent impulses, which may be ours, if we are only loving and generous and
      high-hearted, to the threshold of the dark, and perhaps beyond.

<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Oh, lost and unforgotten friend,
     Whose presence change and chance deny;
     If angels turn your soft proud eye
     To lines your cynic playmate penned,

     Look on them, as you looked on me,
     When both were young; when, as we went
     Through crowds or forest ferns, you leant
     On him who loved your staff to be;

     And slouch your lazy length again
     On cushions fit for aching brow
     (Yours always ached, you know), and now

     As dainty languishing as then,
     Give them but one fastidious look,
     And if you see a trace of him
     Who humoured you in every whim,

     Seek for his heart within his book:
     For though there be enough to mark
     The man's divergence from the boy,
     Yet shines my faith without alloy

     For him who led me through that park;
     And though a stranger throw aside
     Such grains of common sentiment,
     Yet let your haughty head be bent

     To take the jetsom of the tide;
     Because this brackish turbid sea
     Throws toward thee things that pleased of yore,
     And though it wash thy feet no more,

     Its murmurs mean: "I yearn for thee."
     The world may like, for all I care,
     The gentler voice, the cooler head,
     That bows a rival to despair,

     And cheaply compliments the dead;
     That smiles at all that's coarse and rash,
     Yet wins the trophies of the fight,
     Unscathed, in honour's wreck and crash,

     Heartless, but always in the right;.
     Thanked for good counsel by the judge
     Who tramples on the bleeding brave,
     Thanked too by him who will not budge
     From claims thrice hallowed by the grave.

     Thanked, and self-pleased: ay, let him wear
     What to that noble breast was due;
     And I, dear passionate Teucer, dare
     Go through the homeless world with you.

<pre xml:space="preserve">
     You promise heavens free from strife,
     Pure truth, and perfect change of will;
     But sweet, sweet is this human life,
     So sweet, I fain would breathe it still;
     Your chilly stars I can forego,
     This warm kind world is all I know.

     You say there is no substance here,
     One great reality above:
     Back from that void I shrink in fear,
     And child-like hide myself in love:
     Show me what angels feel. Till then,
     I cling, a mere weak man, to men.

     You bid me lift my mean desires
     From faltering lips and fitful veins
     To sexless souls, ideal quires,
     Unwearied voices, wordless strains:
     My mind with fonder welcome owns
     One dear dead friend's remembered tones.

     Forsooth the present we must give
     To that which cannot pass away;
     All beauteous things for which we live
     By laws of time and space decay.
     But oh, the very reason why
     I clasp them, is because they die.

     For all that wrong sweet love atoned.

     He led me trembling to the ship,
     He seemed at least to love me then;
     He soothed, he clasped me lip to lip:
     How strange, to wed the king of men.

      STESICHORUS
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Queen of the Argives, (thus the poet spake,)
     Great lady Helen, thou hast made me wise;
     Veiled is the world, but all the soul awake,
     Purged by thine anger, clearer far than eyes.

     Peep is the darkness; for my bride is hidden,
     Crown of my glory, guerdon of my song:
     Preod is the vision; thou art here unbidden,
     Mute and reproachful, since I did thee wrong.

     Sweetest of wanderers, grievest thou for friends
     Tricked by a phantom, cheated to the grave?
     Woe worth the God, the mocking God, that sends
     Lies to the pious, furies to the brave.

     Pardon our falsehood: thou wert far away,
     Gathering the lotus down the Egypt-water,
     Wifely and duteous, hearing not the fray,
     Taking no stain from all those years of slaughter:

     Guiltless, yet mournful. Tell the poets truths;
     Tell them real beauty leadeth not to strife;
     Weep for the slain, those many blooming youths:
     Tears such as thine might bring them back to life.

     Dear, gentle lady, if the web's unthreaded,
     Slander and fable fairly rent in twain,
     Then, by the days when thou wert loved and wedded,
     Give me, I pray, my bride's glad smile again.

     The lord, who leads the Spartan host,
     Stands with a little maid,
     To greet a stranger from the coast
     Who comes to seek his aid.

     What brings the guest? a disk of brass
     With curious lines engraven:
     What mean the lines? stream, road, and pass,
     Forest, and town, and haven.

     "Lo, here Choaspes' lilied field:
     Lo, here the Hermian plain:
     What need we save the Doric shield
     To stop the Persian's reign?

     Or shall barbarians drink their nil
     Upon the slopes of Tmolus?
     Or trowsered robbers spoil at will
     The bounties of Pactolus?

     Salt lakes, burnt uplands, lie between;
     The distant king moves slow;
     He starts, ere Smyrna's vines are green,
     Comes, when their juices flow.

     Waves bright with morning smoothe thy course,
     Swift row the Samian galleys;
     Unconquered Colophon sounds to horse
     Up the broad eastern valleys.

     Is not Apollo's call enough,
     The god of every Greek?
     Then take our gold, and household stuff;
     Claim what thou wilt, but speak."

     He falters; for the waves he fears,
     The roads he cannot measure;
     But rates full high the gleam of spears
     And dreams of yellow treasure.

     He listens; he is yielding now;
     Outspoke the fearless child:

     "Oh, father, come away, lest thou
     Be by this man beguiled."
     Her lowly judgement barred the plea,
     So low, it could not reach her.

     The man knows more of land and sea,
     But she's the truer teacher.
     I mind the day, when thou didst cheat
     Those rival dames with answer meet;

     When, toiling at the loom,
     Unblest with bracelet, ring, or chain,
     Thou alone didst dare disdain
     To toil in tiring-room.

     Merely thou saidst: "At set of sun
     My humble taskwork will be done;
     And through the twilight street
     Come back to view my jewels, when
     Pattering through the throng of men
     Go merry schoolboys' feet."

     The web well finished up, one hand
     Laid on my yielding shoulder:
     The sternest stripling in the land
     Grasped the other, boldly scanned
     Their faces, and grew bolder:

     And said: "Fair ladies, by your leave
     I would exhort you spin and weave
     Some frugal homely cloth.
     I warn you, when I lead the tribes
     Law shall strip you; threats nor bribes

     I shivered, hid my tingling cheek
     Behind thy marble face;
     And prayed the gods to be like him,
     Firm in temper, lithe of limb,
     Right worthy of our race.

     Oh, mother, didst thou bear me brave?
     Or was I weak, till, from the grave
     So early hollowed out,
     Tiberius sought me yesternight,
     Blood upon his mantle white,
     A vision clear of doubt?

     What can I fear, oh mother, now?
     His dead cold hand is on my brow;
     Rest thou thereon thy lips:
     His voice is in the night-wind's breath,
     "Do as I did," still he saith;
     With blood his finger drips.

     Thou leapest from the thinner streams of air
     To crags where vapours cling, where ocean frets;
     No cave so deep, so cold, but thou art there,
     Wrath in thy smile, and beauty in thy threats.

<pre xml:space="preserve">
     I never prayed for Dryads, to haunt the woods again;
     More welcome were the presence of hungering, thirst-
     ing men,
     Whose doubts we could unravel, whose hopes we
     could fulfil,
     Our wisdom tracing backward, the river to the rill;
     Were such beloved forerunners one summer day
     restored,
     Then, then we might discover the Muse's mystic hoard.

     Oh dear divine Comatas, I would that thou and I
     Beneath this broken sunlight this leisure day might lie;
     Where trees from distant forests, whose names were
     strange to thee,
     Should bend their amorous branches within thy reach
     to be,
     And flowers thine Hellas knew not, which art hath
     made more fair,
     Should shed their shining petals upon thy fragrant
     hair.

     Then thou shouldst calmly listen with ever-changing
     looks
     To songs of younger minstrels and plots of modern
     books,
     And wonder at the daring of poets later born,
     Whose thoughts are unto thy thoughts as noon-tide is
     to morn;
     And little shouldst thou grudge them their greater
     strength of soul,
     Thy partners in the torch-race, though nearer to the
     goal.

     As when ancestoral portraits look gravely from the walls
     Uplift youthful baron who treads their echoing
     halls;
     And whilst he builds new turrets, the thrice ennobled
     heir
     Would gladly wake his grandsire his home and feast
     to share;
     So from Ã†gean laurels that hide thine ancient urn
     I fain would call thee hither, my sweeter lore to learn.

     Or in thy cedarn prison thou waitest for the bee:
     Ah, leave that simple honey, and take thy food from
     me.
     My sun is stooping westward. Entranced dreamer,
     haste;
     There's fruitage in my garden, that I would have thee
     taste.

      TWO FRAGMENTS OF CHILDHOOD
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     When these locks were yellow as gold,
     When past days were easily told,
     Well I knew the voice of the sea,
     Once he spake as a friend to me.

     Thunder-roarings carelessly heard,
     Once that poor little heart they stirred.
     Why, oh, why?
     Memory, Memory!
     She that I wished to be with was by.

     Sick was I in those misanthrope days
     Of soft caresses, womanly ways;
     Once that maid on the stairs I met,
     Lip on brow she suddenly set.

     Then flushed up my chivalrous blood
     Like Swiss streams in a midsummer flood.
     Then, oh, then,
     Imogen, Imogen!
     Hadst thou a lover, whose years were ten.

      WAR MUSIC
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     One hour of my boyhood, one glimpse of the past,
     One beam of the dawn ere the heavens were o'ercast.

     I came to a castle by royalty's grace,
     Forgot I was bashful, and feeble, and base.
     For stepping to music I dreamt of a siege,
     A vow to my mistress, a fight for my liege.
     The first sound of trumpets that fell on mine ear
     Set warriors around me and made me their peer.
     Meseemed we were arming, the bold for the fair,
     In joyous devotion and haughty despair:
     The warders were waiting to draw bolt and bar,
     The maidens attiring to gaze from afar:

     I thought of the sally, but not the retreat,
     The cause was so glorious, the dying so sweet.

     I live, I am old, I return to the ground:
     Blow trumpets, and still I can dream to the sound.

     So can quicken human thought,
     That the startled fancies spring
     Faster far than voice or wing.

     And the songstress as she floats
     Rising on her buoyant notes,
     Though she may the while refuse
     Homage to the nobler Muse,
     Though she cannot truly tell
     How her voice hath wrought the spell,
     Fills the listener's eyes with tears,
     Lifts him to the inner spheres.

     Lark, thy morning song is done;
     Overhead the silent sun
     Bids thee pause. But he that heard
     Such a strain must bless the bird.

     Fell at Culloden to a man.

      A QUEEN'S VISIT
    </h2>
    <h3>
      June 4, 1851
    </h3>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     From vale to vale, from shore to shore,
     The lady Gloriana passed,
     To view her realms: the south wind bore
     Her shallop to Belleisle at last.

     A quiet mead, where willows bend
     Above the curving wave, which rolls
     On slowly crumbling banks, to send
     Its hard-won spoils to lazy shoals.

     Beneath an oak weird eddies play,
     Where fate was writ for Saxon seer;
     And yonder park is white with may,
     Where shadowy hunters chased the deer.

     In rows half up the chestnut, perch
     Stiff-silvered fairies; busy rooks
     Caw front the elm; and, rung to church,
     Mute anglers drop their caddised hooks.

     They troop between the dark-red walls,
     When the twin towers give four-fold chimes;
     And lo! the breaking groups, where falls
     'Tim chequered shade of quivering limes.

     'They come from field and wharf and street
     With dewy hair and veined throat,
     One fluor to tread with reverent feet,&mdash;
     One hour of rest for ball and boat:

     Like swallows gathering for their flight,
     When autumn whispers, play no more,
     They check the laugh, with fancies bright
     Still hovering round the sacred door.

     Lo! childhood swelling into seed,
     Lo! manhood bursting from the bud:
     Two growths, unlike; yet all agreed
     To trust the movement of the blood.

     They toil at games, and play with books:
     They love the winner of the race,
     If only he that prospers looks
     On prizes with a simple grace.

     The many leave the few to choose;
     They scorn not him who turns aside
     To woo alone a milder Muse,
     If shielded by a tranquil pride.

     When thought is claimed, when pain is borne,
     Whate'er is done in this sweet isle,
     There's none that may not lift his horn,
     If only lifted with a smile.

     So here dwells freedom; nor could she,
     Who ruled in every clime on earth,
     Find any spring more fit to be
     The fountain of her festal mirth.

     Elsewhere she sought for lore and art,
     But hither came for vernal joy:
     Nor was this all: she smote the heart
     And woke the hero in the boy.

     Faint radiance on a cold Arvernian plain,
     Where I, far severed from that youthful crew,
     Far from the gay disguise thy witcheries threw
     On wave and dripping oar, still own thy reign,
     Travelling with thee through many a sleepless hour.
     Now shrink, like my weak will: a sterner power
     Empurpleth yonder hills beneath thee piled,
     Hills, where CÃ¦sarian sovereignty was won
     On high basaltic levels blood-defiled,

      AFTER READING "MAUD"
    </h2>
    <h3>
      September, 1855
    </h3>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Twelve years ago, if he had died,
     His critic friends had surely cried:
     "Death does us wrong, the fates are cross;
     Nor will this age repair the loss.
     Fine was the promise of his youth;
     Time would have brought him deeper truth.
     Some earnest of his wealth he gave,
     Then hid his treasures in the grave."
     And proud that they alone on earth
     Perceived what might have been his worth,
     They would have kept their leader's name
     Linked with a fragmentary fame.
     Forsooth the beech's knotless stem,
     If early felled, were dear to them.

     But the fair tree lives on, and spreads
     Its scatheless boughs above their heads,
     And they are pollarded by cares,
     And give themselves religious airs,
     And grow not, whilst the forest-king
     Strikes high and deep from spring to spring.
     So they would have his branches rise
     In theoretic symmetries;
     They see a twist in yonder limb,
     The foliage not precisely trim;
     Some gnarled roughness they lament,
     Take credit for their discontent,
     And count his flaws, serenely wise
     With motes of pity in their eyes;
     As if they could, the prudent fools,
     Adjust such live-long growth to rules,
     As if so strong a soul could thrive
     Fixed in one shape at thirty-five.
     Leave him to us, ye good and sage,
     Who stiffen in your middle age.

     Ye loved him once, but now forbear;
     Yield him to those who hope and dare,
     And have not yet to forms consigned
     A rigid, ossifying mind.

     One's feelings lose poetic flow
     Soon after twenty-seven or so;
     Professionizing moral men
     Thenceforth admire what pleased them then;
     The poems bought in youth they read,
     And say them over like their creed.
     All autumn crops of rhyme seem strange;
     Their intellect resents the change.

     They cannot follow to the end
     Their more susceptive college-friend:
     He runs from field to field, and they
     Stroll in their paddocks making hay:
     He's ever young, and they get old;
     Poor things, they deem him over-bold:
     What wonder, if they stare and scold?

      A STUDY OF BOYHOOD
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     So young, and yet so worn with pain!
     No sign of youth upon that stooping head,
     Save weak half-curls, like beechen boughs that spread
     With up-turned edge to catch the hurrying rain;

     Such little lint-white locks, as wound
     About a mother's finger long ago,
     When he was blither, not more dear, for woe
     Was then far off, and other sons stood round.

     And she has wept since then with him
     Watching together, where the ocean gave
     To her child's counted breathings wave for wave,
     Whilst the heart fluttered, and the eye grew dim.

     And when the sun and day-breeze fell,
     She kept with him the vigil of despair;
     Knit hands for comfort, blended sounds of prayer,
     Saw him at dawn face death, and take farewell;

     Saw him grow holier through his grief,
     The early grief that lined his withering brow,
     As one by one her stars were quenched. And now
     He that so mourned can play, though life is brief;

     Not gay, but gracious; plain of speech,
     And freely kindling under beauty's ray,
     He dares to speak of what he loves; to-day
     He talked of art, and led me on to teach,

     And glanced, as poets glance, at pages
     Full of bright Florence and warm Umbrian skies;
     Not slighting modern greatness, for the wise
     Can sort the treasures of the circling ages;

     Not echoing the sickly praise,
     Which boys repeat, who hear a father's guest
     Prate of the London show-rooms; what is best
     He firmly lights upon, as birds on sprays;

     All honest, and all delicate:
     No room for flattery, no smiles that ask
     For tender pleasantries, no looks that mask
     The genial impulses of love and hate.

     Oh bards that call to bank and glen,
     Ye bid me go to nature to be healed!
     And lo! a purer fount is here revealed:
     My lady-nature dwells in heart of men.

     That vivid soul then first unsealed
     Would be, they knew, a torch to wave
     Within a chill and dusky cave
     Whose crystals else were unrevealed.

     That fine small mouth they wreathed so well
     In rosy curves, would rouse to arms
     A troop then bound in slumber-charms;
     Such notes they gave the magic shell.

     Those straying fingerlets, that clutched
     At good and bad, they so did glove,
     That they might pick the flowers of love,
     Unscathed, from every briar they touched.

     The bounteous sisters did ordain,
     That thou one day with jest and whim
     Should'st rain thy merriment on him
     Whose life, when thou wert born, was pain.

     For haply on that night they spied
     A sickly student at his books,
     Who having basked in loving looks
     Was freezing into barren pride.

     His squalid discontent they saw,
     And, for that he had worshipped them
     With incense and with anadem,
     They willed his wintry world should thaw;

     And at thy cradle did decree
     That fifteen years should pass, and thou
     Should'st breathe upon that pallid brow
     Favonian airs of mirth and glee.

<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Our planet runs through liquid space,
     And sweeps us with her in the race;
     And wrinkles gather on my face,
     And Hebe bloom on thine:
     Our sun with his encircling spheres
     Around the central sun careers;
     And unto thee with mustering years
     Come hopes which I resign.

     'Twere sweet for me to keep thee still
     Reclining halfway up the hill;
     But time will not obey the will,
     And onward thou must climb:
     'Twere sweet to pause on this descent,
     To wait for thee and pitch my tent,
     But march I must with shoulders bent,
     Yet farther from my prime.

     I shall not tread thy battle-field,
     Nor see the blazon on thy shield;
     Take thou the sword I could not wield,
     And leave me, and forget
     Be fairer, braver, more admired;
     So win what feeble hearts desired;
     Then leave thine arms, when thou art tired,
     To some one nobler yet.

    <h2>
      A CRUISE
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Your princely progress is begun;
     And pillowed on the bounding deck
     You break with dark brown hair a sun
     That falls transfigured on your neck.
     Sail on, and charm sun, wind, and sea.
     Oh! might that love-light rest on me!

     Vacantly lingering with the hours,
     The sacred hours that still remain
     From that rich month of fruits and flowers
     Which brought you near me once again,
     By thoughts of you, though roses die,
     I strive to make it still July.

     Soft waves are strown beneath your prow,
     Like carpets for a victor's feet;
     You call slow zephyrs to your brow,
     In listless luxury complete:
     Love, the true Halcyon, guides your ship;
     Oh, might his pinion touch my lip!

     I by the shrunken river stroll;
     And changed, since I was left alone,
     With tangled weed and rising shoal,
     The loss I mourn he seems to own:
     This is, how base soe'er his sloth,
     This is the stream that bore us both.

     For you shall granite peaks uprise
     As old and scornful as your race,
     And fringed with firths of lucent dyes
     The jewelled beach your limbs embrace.
     Oh bather, may those Western gems
     Remind you of my lilied Thames.

     I too have seen the castled West,
     Her Cornish creeks, her Breton ports,
     Her caves by knees of hermits pressed,
     Her fairy islets bright with quartz:
     And dearer now each well-known scene,
     For what shall be than what hath been.

     Obeisance of kind strangers' eyes,
     Triumphant cannons' measured roar,
     Doffed plumes, and martial courtesies,
     Shall greet you on the Norman shore.
     Oh, that I were a stranger too,
     To win that first sweet glance from you.

     I was a stranger once: and soon
     Beyond desire, above belief,
     Thy soul was as a crescent moon,
     A bud expanding leaf by leaf.
     I'd pray thee now to close, to wane,
     So that 'twere all to do again.

    <h2>
      A SEPARATION
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     I may not touch the hand I saw
     So nimbly weave the violet chain;
     I may not see my artist draw
     That southward-sloping lawn again.
     But joy brimmed over when we met,
     Nor can I mourn our parting yet.

     Though he lies sick and far away,
     I play with those that still are here,
     Not honouring him the less, for they
     To me by loving him are dear:
     They share, they soothe my fond regret,
     Since neither they nor I forget.

     His sweet strong heart so nobly beat
     With scorn and pity, mirth and zeal,
     That vibrant hearts of ours repeat
     What they with him were wont to feel;
     Still quiring in that higher key,
     Till he take up the melody.

     If there be any music here,
     I trust it will not fail, like notes
     Of May-birds, when the warning year
     Abates their summer-wearied throats.
     Shame on us, if we drudge once more
     As dull and tuneless as before.

     Without him I was weak and coarse,
     My soul went droning through the hours,
     His goodness stirred a latent force
     That drew from others kindred powers.
     Nor they nor I could think me base,
     When with their prince I had found grace.

     His influence crowns me, like a cloud
     Steeped in the light of a lost sun:
     I reign, for willing knees are bowed
     And light behests are gladly done:
     So Rome obeyed the lover-king,
     Who drank at pure Egeria's spring.

     Such honour doth my mind perplex:
     For, who is this, I ask, that dares
     With manhood's wounds, and virtue's wrecks,
     And tangled creeds, and subtle cares,
     Affront the look, or speak the name
     Of one who from Elysium came.

     And yet, though withered and forlorn,
     I had renounced what man desires,
     I'd thought some poet might be born
     To string my lute with silver wires;
     At least in brighter days to come
     Such men as I would not lie dumb.

     I saw the Sibyl's finger rest
     On fate's unturned imagined page,
     Believed her promise, and was blest
     With dreams of that heroic age.
     She sent me, ere my hope was cold,
     One of the race that she foretold.

     His fellows time will bring, and they,
     In manifold affections free,
     Shall scatter pleasures day by day
     Like blossoms rained from windy tree.
     So let that garden bloom; and I,
     Content with one such flower, will die.

      A NEW MICHONNET

<pre xml:space="preserve">
     The foster-child forgets his nurse:
     She doth but know what he hath been,
     Took him for better or for worse,
     Would pet him, though he be sixteen.

     He helps to weave the soft quadrille;
     Ah! leave the parlour door ajar;
     Those thirsting eyes shall take their fill,
     And watch her darling from afar.

     It is her pride to see the hand,
     Which wont so wantonly to tear
     Her unblanched curls, control the band,
     And change the tune, with such an air.

     And who so good? she thinks, or who
     So fit for partners rich and tall?
     Indeed she's looked the ball-room through,
     And he's the loveliest lad of all.

     So to her lonesome bed: and there,
     If any wandering notes she hear,
     She'll say in pauses of her prayer,
     "He dancing still, my child! my dear!"

     His gladness doth on her redound,
     Though hair be grey, and eyes be dim:
     At every waif of broken sound
     She'll wake, and smile, and think of him.

     So, noblest of the noble, go
     Through regions echoing thy name;
     And even on me, thy friend, shall flow
     Some streamlet from thy river of fame.

     Thou to the gilded youth be kind;
     Shed all thy genius-rays on them;
     An ancient comrade stands behind
     To touch, unseen, thy mantle's hem.

     A stranger to thy peers am I,
     And slighted, like that poor old crone,
     And yet some clinging memories try
     To rate thy conquests as mine own.

     Nay, when at random drops thy praise
     From lips of happy lookers-on,
     My tearful eyes I proudly raise,
     And bid my conscious self be gone.

     Love, like an island, held a single heart,
     Waiting for shoreward flutterings of the breeze,
     So might it waft to him that sat apart
     Some angel guest from out the clouded seas.

     Was it mere chance that threw within his reach
     Fragments and symbols of the bliss unknown?
     Was it vague hope that murmured down the beach,
     Tuning the billows and the cavern's moan?

     Oft through the aching void the promise thrilled:
     "Thou shalt be loved, and Time shall pay his debt."
     Silence returns upon the wish fulfilled,
     Joy for a year, and then a sweet regret.

     Idol, mine Idol, whom this touch profanes,
     Pass as thou cam'st across the glimmering seas:
     All, all is lost but memory's sacred pains;
     Leave me, oh leave me, ere I forfeit these.

    <h2>
      A FABLE
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     An eager girl, whose father buys
     Some ruined thane's forsaken hall,
     Explores the new domain, and tries
     Before the rest to view it all.

     Alone she lifts the latch, and glides
     Through many a sadly curtained room,
     As daylight through the doorway slides
     And struggles with the muffled gloom.

     With mimicries of dance she wakes
     The lordly gallery's silent floor,
     And climbing up on tiptoe, makes
     The old-world mirror smile once more.

     With tankards dry she chills her lip,
     With yellowing laces veils the head,
     And leaps in pride of ownership
     Upon the faded marriage bed.

     A harp in some dark nook she sees,
     Long left a prey to heat and frost.
     She smites it: can such tinklings please?
     Is not all worth, all beauty, lost?

     Ah! who'd have thought such sweetness clung
     To loose neglected strings like those?
     They answered to whate'er was sung,
     And sounded as the lady chose.

     Her pitying finger hurried by
     Each vacant space, each slackened chord;
     Nor would her wayward zeal let die
     The music-spirit she restored.

     The fashion quaint, the time-worn flaws,
     The narrow range, the doubtful tone,
     All was excused awhile, because
     It seemed a creature of her own.

     Perfection tires; the new in old,
     The mended wrecks that need her skill,
     Amuse her. If the truth be told,
     She loves the triumph of her will.

     With this, she dares herself persuade,
     She'll be for many a month content,
     Quite sure no duchess ever played
     Upon a sweeter instrument.

     And thus in sooth she can beguile
     Girlhood's romantic hours: but soon
     She yields to taste and mode and style,
     A siren of the gay saloon;

     And wonders how she once could like
     Those drooping wires, those failing notes,
     And leaves her toy for bats to strike
     Amongst the cobwebs and the motes.

     But enter in, thou freezing wind,
     And snap the harp-strings one by one;
     It was a maiden blithe and kind:
     They felt her touch; their task is done.

      AMAVI
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Ask, mournful Muse, by one alone inspired:
     What change? am I less fond, or thou less fair?
     Or is it, that thy mounting soul is tired
     Of duteous homage and religious care?

     So many court thee that my reverent gaze
     Vexes that wilful and capricious eye;
     Such fine rare flatteries flow to thee, that praise,
     From one whose thoughts thou know'st, seems poor
     and dry.

     So must it be. Thus monarchs blandly greet
     Strange heralds offering tribute, and forget
     The vassals ranked behind the golden seat,
     Whose annual gift is counted as a debt.

     Since sure of me thy liegeman once in thrall
     Thou need'st not waste on me those gracious looks.
     Stirred by the newborn wish to conquer all,
     Leave thy first subject to his rhymes and books.

     Ah! those impetuous claims that drew me forth
     From my cold shadows to thy dazzling day,
     Those spells that lured me to the stately North,
     Those pleas against my scruples, where are they?

     Oh, glorious bondage in a dreamful bower!
     Oh, freedom thrice abhorred, unblest release!
     Why, why hath cruel circumstance the power
     To make such worship, such obedience cease?

     Surely I served thee, as the wrinkled elm
     Yieldeth his nature to the jocund vine,
     Strength unto beauty: may the flood o'erwhelm
     Root, trunk, and branch, if they have not been thine.

     If thine no more, if lightly left behind,
     To guard the dancing clusters thought unmeet,
     It is because with gilded trellis twined
     Thy liberal growth demands untempered heat.

     Yet, while they spread more freely to the sun,
     Those tendrils; while they wanton in the breeze
     Gathering all heaven's bounties, henceforth one
     Abides more honoured than the neighbouring trees.

     Ah dear, there's something left of that great gift;
     And humbly marvelling at thy former choice
     A head once crowned with love I dare uplift,
     And, for that once I pleased thee, still rejoice.

      NOTES OF AN INTERVIEW
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     It is but little that remaineth
     Of the kindness that you gave me,
     And that little precious remnant you withhold.
     Go free; I know that time constraineth,
     Wilful blindness could not save me:
     Yet you say I caused the change that I foretold.

     At every sweet unasked relenting,
     Though you'd tried me with caprice,
     Did my welcome, did my gladness ever fail?
     To-day not loud is my lamenting:
     Do not chide me; it shall cease:
     Could I think of vanished love without a wail?

     Elsewhere, you lightly say, are blooming
     All the graces I desire:
     Thus you goad me to the treason of content:
     If ever, when your brow is glooming,
     Softer faces I admire,
     Then your lightnings make me tremble and repent.

     Grant this: whatever else beguileth
     Restless dreaming, drowsy toil,
     As a plaything, as a windfall, let me hail it.
     Believe: the brightest one that smileth
     To your beaming is a foil,
     To the splendour breaking from you, though you veil it.

      DETERIORA
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     One year I lived in high romance,
     A soul ennobled by the grace
     Of one whose very frowns enhance
     The regal lustre of the face,
     And in the magic of a smile
     I dwelt as in Calypso's isle.

     One year, a narrow line of blue,
     With clouds both ways awhile held back:
     And dull the vault that line goes through,
     And frequent now the crossing rack;
     And who shall pierce the upper sky,
     And count the spheres? Not I, not I!

     Sweet year, it was not hope you brought,
     Nor after toil and storm repose,
     But a fresh growth of tender thought,
     And all of love my spirit knows.
     You let my lifetime pause, and bade
     The noontide dial cast no shade.

     If fate and nature screen from me
     The sovran front I bowed before,
     And set the glorious creature free,
     Whom I would clasp, detain, adore;
     If I forego that strange delight,
     Must all be lost? Not quite, not quite.

     Die, little Love, without complaint,
     Whom Honour standeth by to shrive:
     AssoilÃ¨d from all selfish taint,
     Die, Love, whom Friendship will survive.
     Nor heat nor folly gave thee birth;
     And briefness does but raise thy worth.

     Let the grey hermit Friendship hoard
     Whatever sainted Love bequeathed,
     And in some hidden scroll record
     The vows in pious moments breathed.
     Vex not the lost with idle suit,
     Oh lonely heart, be mute, be mute.

      PARTING
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     As when a traveller, forced to journey back,
     Takes coin by coin, and gravely counts them o'er,
     Grudging each payment, fearing lest he lack,
     Before he can regain the friendly shore;
     So reckoned I your sojourn, day by day,
     So grudged I every week that dropt away.

     And as a prisoner, doomed and bound, upstarts
     From shattered dreams of wedlock and repose,
     At sudden rumblings of the market-carts,
     Which bring to town the strawberry and the rose,
     And wakes to meet sure death; so shuddered I,
     To hear you meditate your gay Good-bye.

     But why not gay? For, if there's aught you lose,
     It is but drawing off a wrinkled glove
     To turn the keys of treasuries, free to choose
     Throughout the hundred-chambered house of love,
     This pathos draws from you, though true and kind,
     Only bland pity for the left-behind.

     We part; you comfort one bereaved, unmanned;
     You calmly chide the silence and the grief;
     You touch me once with light and courteous hand,
     And with a sense of something like relief
     You turn away from what may seem to be
     Too hard a trial of your charity.

     So closes in the life of life; so ends
     The soaring of the spirit. What remains?
     To take whate'er the Muse's mother lends,
     One sweet sad thought in many soft refrains
     And half reveal in Coan gauze of rhyme
     A cherished image of your joyous prime.

     Scant room for just a village strip,
     The setting of a sapphire lake.

     And here, when summer draws the kine
     To upland grasses patched with snow,
     Our travellers rest not, only dine,
     Then driven by Furies, onward go.

     For pilgrims of the pointed stick,
     With passport case for scallop shell,
     Scramble for worshipped Alps too quick
     To care for vales where mortals dwell.

     Twice daily swarms the hostel's pier,
     Twice daily is the table laid;
     And, "Oh, that some would tarry here!"
     Sighs Madeline, the serving-maid.

     She shows them silly carven stuff;
     Some sneer, but others smile and buy;
     And these light smiles are quite enough
     To make the wistful maiden sigh.

     She scans the face, but not the mind;
     She learns their taste in wines and toys,
     But, seem they thoughtful and refined,
     She fain would know their cares, their joys.

     For man is not as horse and hound,
     Who turn to meet their lord's caress,
     Yet never miss the touch or sound,
     When absence brings unconsciousness.

     Not such the souls that can reflect;
     Too mild they may be to repine;
     But sometimes, winged with intellect,
     They strain to pass the bounding line.

     And to have learnt our pleasant tongue
     In English mansions, gave a sense
     Of something bitter-sweet, that stung
     The pensive maiden of Brientz.

     I will not say she wished for aught;
     For, failing guests, she duly spun,
     And saved for marriage; but one thought
     Would still in alien channels run.

     And when at last a lady came,
     Not lovely, but with twofold grace,
     For courtly France had tuned her name,
     Whilst England reigned in hair and face;

     And illness bound her many a day,
     A willing captive, to the mere,
     In peace, though home was far away,
     For Madeline's talking brought it near.

     Then delicate words unused before
     Rose to her lips, as amber shines
     Thrown by the wave upon the shore
     From unimagined ocean-mines;

     And then perceptions multiplied,
     Foreshadowings of the heart came true,
     And interlaced on every side
     Old girlish fancies bloomed and grew;

     And looks of higher meaning gleamed
     Like azure sheen of mountain ice,
     And common household service seemed
     The wageless work of Paradise.

     But autumn downward drove the kine,
     And clothed the wheel with flaxen thread,
     And sprinkled snow upon the pine,
     And bowed the silent spinster's head.

     Then Europe's tumult scared the spring,
     And checked the Northern travel-drift:
     Yet to Brientz did summer bring
     An English letter and a gift;

     And Madeline took them with a tear:
     "How gracious to remember me!
     Her words I'll keep from year to year,
     Her face in heaven I hope to see."

     Oh little slumbering maid,
     If thou wert five years older,
     Thine head would not be laid
     So simply on my shoulder!

     Oh, would that I were younger,

     Can you so fair and young forecast
     The sure, the cruel day of doom;

     Will fall, fall, fall down to the tomb?
     Unclouded, fearless, gentle soul,
     You greet the foe whose threats you hear;
     Your lifted eyes discern the goal,
     Your blood declares it is not near.

     Feel deeply; toil through weal and woe,
     Love England, love a friend, a bride.
     Bid wisdom grow, let sorrow flow,
     Make many weep when you have died.

     Will you perish, calmly sinking
     To a sunless deep sea cave,
     Folding hands, and kindly thinking
     Of the friend you tried to save?
     Will you let your sweet breath pass
     On the arms of children bending,
     Gazing on the sea of glass,
     Where the lovelight has no ending?

     Or in victory stern and fateful,
     Colours wrapt round shattered breast,
     English maidens rescued, grateful,
     Whispering near you, "Conqueror, rest;"
     Or an old tune played once more,
     Tender cadence oft repeated,
     Moonlight shed through open door,
     Angel wife beside you seated.

     Long, long shall they mourn thee that see thee depart.

     With half a moon, and cloudlets pink,
     And water-lilies just in bud,
     With iris on the river brink,
     And white weed garlands on the mud,
     And roses thin and pale as dreams,
     And happy cygnets born in May,
     No wonder if our country seems

     Or of the leek His Highness chewed,
     Or of the stone he wrote upon?
     To Freedom born so long ago,
     We do devoir in very deed,
     If heedless as the clouds we row
     With fruit and wine to Runnymede.

     Ah! life is short, and learning long;
     We're midway through our mirthful June,
     And feel about for words of song
     To help us through some dear old tune.
     We firmly, fondly seize the joy,
     As tight as fingers press the oar,
     With love and laughter girl and boy
     Hold the sweet days, and make them more.

     And when our northern stars have set
     For ever on the maid we lose,
     Beneath our feet she'll not forget
     How speed the hours with Eton crews.
     Then round the world, good river, run,
     And though with you no boat may glide,
     Kind river, bear some drift of fun
     And friendship to the exile bride.

     We come in arms, we stand ten score,
     Embattled on the castle green;
     We grasp our firelocks tight, for war
     Is threatening, and we see our Queen.

     And "will the churls last out till we
     Have duly hardened bones and thews
     For scouring leagues of swamp and sea
     Of braggart mobs and corsair crews?

     We ask; we fear not scoff or smile
     At meek attire of blue and grey,
     For the proud wrath that thrills our isle
     Gives faith and force to this array.

     So great a charm is England's right,
     That hearts enlarged together flow,
     And each man rises up a knight
     To work the evil-thinkers woe.

     And, girt with ancient truth and grace,
     We do our service and our suit,
     And each can be, what'er his race,
     A Chandos or a Montacute.

     Thou, Mistress, whom we serve to-day,
     Bless the real swords that we shall wield,
     Repeat the call we now obey
     In sunset lands, on some fair field.

     Thy flag shall make some Huron Rock
     As dear to us as Windsor's keep,
     And arms thy Thames hath nerved shall mock
     The surgings of th' Ontarian deep.

     The stately music of thy Guards,
     Which times our march beneath thy ken,
     Shall sound, with spells of sacred bards,
     From heart to heart, when we are men.

     And when we bleed on alien earth,
     We'll call to mind how cheers of ours
     Proclaimed a loud uncourtly mirth
     Amongst thy glowing orange bowers.

     And if for England's sake we fall,
     So be it, so thy cross be won,
     Fixed by kind hands on silvered pall,
     And worn in death, for duty done.

     Ah! thus we fondle Death, the soldier's mate,
     Blending his image with the hopes of youth
     To hallow all; meanwhile the hidden fate
     Chills not our fancies with the iron truth.

     Death from afar we call, and Death is here,
     To choose out him who wears the loftiest mien;
     And Grief, the cruel lord who knows no peer,
     Breaks through the shield of love to pierce our
     Queen.

     The world's impetuous bigot force,
     Which drives the young before they will,
     And when they will not drives them still.

     Come hither, thou that would'st forget
     The gamester's smile, the trader's vaunt,
     The statesman actor's face hard set,
     The kennel cry that cheers his taunt,
     Come where pure winds and rills combine
     To murmur peace round virtue's shrine.

     Virtue&mdash;men thrust her back, when these
     Rode down for Charles and right divine,
     And those with dogma Genevese
     Restored in faith their wavering line.
     No virtue in religious camps,
     No heathen oil in Gideon's lamps.

     And now, when forcing seasons bud
     With prophet, hero, saint, and quack,
     When creeds and fashions heat the blood,
     And transcendental tonguelets clack,
     Sweet Virtue's lyre we hardly know,
     And think her odes quite rococo.

     Well, be it Roman, be it worse,
     When Pelhams reigned in George's name
     Poets were safe from sneer or curse
     Who gave a patriot classic fame,
     And goodness, void of passion, knit
     The hearts of Lyttelton and Pitt.

     That age was as a neutral vale
     'Twixt uplands of tumultuous strife,
     And turning from the sects to hail
     Composure and a graceful life,
     Here, where the fern-clad streamlet flows,
     Boconnoc's guests ensured repose.

     That charm remains; and he who knows
     The root and stock of freedom's laws,
     Unscared by frenzied nations' throes,
     And hugging yet the good old cause,
     Finds in the shade these beeches cast
     The wit, the fragrance of the past.

    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     The door hath closed behind the sighing priest,
     The last absolving Latin duly said,
     And night, barred slowly backward from the East,
     Lets in the dawn to mock a sleepless bed;

     The bed of one who yester even took
     From scented aumbries store of silk and lace,
     From caskets beads and rings, for one last look,
     One look, which left the teardrops on her face;

     A lady, who hath loved the world, the court,
     Loved youth and splendour, loved her own sweet
     soul,
     And meekly stoops to learn that life is short,
     Dame Nature's pitiful gift, a beggar's dole.

     Sweet life, ah! let her live what yet remains.
     Call, quickly call, the page who bears the lute;
     Bid him attune to descant of sad strains
     The lily voice we thought for ever mute.

     The sorrowing minstrel at the casement stands
     And bends before the sun that gilds his wires,
     And prays a blessing on his faltering hands,
     That they may serve his lady's last desires.

     "Play something old and soft, a song I knew;
     Play <i>La dÃ©faite des Suisses,</i>" Then pearly notes
     Come dropping one by one, and with the dew
     Down on the breath of morning music floats.

     He played as far as <i>tout est perdu</i> and wept.
     "<i>Tout est perdu</i> again, once more," she sighed;
     And on, still softer on, the music crept,
     And softly, at the pause, the listener died.

     For writings on the sand that leave

     Waste, waste; each knoweth his own worth,
     And would be something ere he sink
     To silence, ere he mix with earth,
     And part with love, and cease to think.

     Shall I then comfort thee and me,
     My neighbour, preaching thus of waste?
     Count yonder planet fragments; see,
     The meteors into darkness haste.

     Lo! myriad germs at random float,
     Fall on no fostering home, and die
     Back to mere elements; every mote
     Was framed for life as thou, as I.

     For ages over soulless eyes,
     Ere man was born, the heavens in vain
     Dipt clouds in dawn and sunset dyes
     Unheeded, and shall we complain?

     Aye, Nature plays that wanton game
     And Nature's hierophants may smile,
     Contented with their lore; no blame
     To rhymers if they groan meanwhile.

     Since that which yearns towards minds of men,
     Which flashes down from brain to lip,
     Finds but cold truth in mammoth den,
     With spores, with stars, no fellowship.

     Say we that our ungamered thought
     Drifts on the stream of all men's fate,
     Our travail is a thing of naught,
     Only because mankind is great.

     Born to be wasted, even so,
     And doomed to feel, and lift no voice;
     Yet not unblessed, because I know
     So many other souls rejoice.

     By drudging through that five-year task?

     "What knowledge or what art is thine?
     Set out thy stock, thy craft declare."

     "I only know they loved me there."

     And wisdom writ in pleasant looks,

     And hardship buoyed with hope, and pain
     Encountered for the common weal,
     And glories void of vulgar gain,
     Were mine to take, were mine to feel.

     Nor from Apollo did I shrink
     Like Titans chained; but sweet and low
     Whispered the Nymphs, who seldom think:
     "Up, up for action, run and row!"

     He let me, though his smile was grave,
     Seek an Egeria out of town
     Beneath the chestnuts; he forgave;
     And should the jealous Muses frown?

     Fieldward some remnants of their lore
     Went with me, as the rhymes of Gray
     Annealed the heart of Wolfe for war
     When drifting on his starlit way.

     Much lost I; something stayed behind,
     A snatch, maybe, of ancient song;
     Some breathings of a deathless mind,
     Some love of truth, some hate of wrong.

     And to myself in games I said,
     "What mean the books? Can I win fame?
     I would be like the faithful dead
     A fearless man, and pure of blame.

     I may have failed, my School may fail;

     Oh, music! breathe me something old to-day,
     Some fine air gliding in from far away,
     Through to the soul that lies behind the clay.

     This hour, if thou did'st ever speak before,
     Speak in the wave that sobs upon the shore,
     Speak in the rill that trickles from the moor.

     Known was this sea's slow chant when I was young;
     To me these rivulets sing as once they sung,
     No need this hour of human throat and tongue.

     The Dead who loved me heard this selfsame tide.
     Oh that the Dead were listening by my side,
     And I could give the fondness then denied.

     Once in the parlour of my mother's sire
     One sang, "And ye shall walk in silk attire."
     Then my cold childhood woke to strange desire.

     That was an unconfessed and idle spell,
     A drop of dew that on a blossom fell;
     And what it wrought I cannot surely tell.

     Far off that thought and changed, like lines that stay
     On withered canvas, pink and pearly grey,
     When rose and violet hues have passed away.

     Oh, had I dwelt with music since that night!
     What life but that is life, what other flight
     Escapes the plaguing doubts of wrong and right!

     Oh music! once I felt the touch of thee,
     Once when this soul was as the chainless sea.
     Oh, could'st thou bid me even now be free!

     This sun, whose javelins strike and gild the wheat,
     Who gives the nectarine half an orb of bloom,
     Burns on my life no less, and beat by beat
     Shapes that grave hour when boyhood hears her
     doom.

     Between this glow of pious eve and me,
     Lost moments, thick as clouds of summer flies,
     Specks of old time, which else one could not see,
     Made manifest in the windless calm, arise.

     Streaks fairy green are traced on backward ways,
     Through vacant regions lightly overleapt,
     With pauses, where in soft pathetic haze
     Are phantoms of the joys that died unwept.

     Seven years since one, who bore with me the yoke
     Of household schooling, missed me from her side.
     When called away from sorrowing woman folk
     A prouder task with brothers twain I plied.

     I came a child, and home was round me still,
     No terror snapt the silken cord of trust;
     My accents changed not, and the low "I will"
     Silenced like halcyon plumes the loud "you must."

     I lisped my Latin underneath the gloom
     Of timbers dark as frowning usher's looks,
     Where thought would stray beyond that sordid room
     To saucy chessmen and to feathered hooks.

     And soon I sat below my grandsire's bust,
     Which in the school he loved not deigns to stand,
     That Earl, who forced his compeers to be just,
     And wrought in brave old age what youth had
     planned.

     But no ancestral majesties could fix
     The wistful eye, which fell, and fondly read,
     Fresh carven on the panel, letters six,
     A brother's name, more sacred than the dead.

     How far too sweet for school he seemed to me,
     How ripe for combat with the wits of men,
     How childlike in his manhood! Can it be?
     Can I indeed be now what he was then?

     He past from sight; my laughing life remained
     Like merry waves that ripple to the bank,
     Curved round the spot where longing eyes are strained,
     Because beneath the lake a treasure sank.

     Dear as the token of a loss to some,
     And praised for likeness, this was well; and yet
     'Twas better still that younger friends should come,
     Whose love might grow entwined with no regret.

     They came; and one was of a northern race,
     Who bore the island galley on his shield,
     Grand histories on his name, and in his face
     A bright soul's ardour fearlessly revealed.

     We trifled, toiled, and feasted, far apart
     From churls, who wondered what our friendship
     meant;
     And in that coy retirement heart to heart
     Drew closer, and our natures were content.

     My noblest playmate lost, I still withdrew
     From dull excitement which the Graces dread,
     And talked in saunterings with the gentle few
     Of tunes we practised, and of rhymes we read.

     We swam through twilight waters, or we played
     Like spellbound captives in the Naiad's grot;
     Coquetted with the oar, and wooed the shade
     On dainty banks of shy forget-me-not.

     Oh Thames! my memories bloom with all thy flowers,
     Thy kindness sighs to me from every tree:
     Farewell I I thank thee for the frolic hours,
     I bid thee, whilst thou flowest, speak of me.

     July 28th, 1864.

      PHAEDRA'S NURSE
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     A plague on the whimsies of sickly folk!
     What am I to do? What not?
     Why, here's the fair sky, and here you lie
     With your couch in a sunny spot.
     For this you were puling whenever you spoke,
     Craving to lie outside,
     And now you'll be sure not to bide.

     You won't lie still for an hour;
     You'll want to be back to your bower&mdash;
     Longing, and never enjoying,
     Shifting from yea to nay.
     For all that you taste is cloying,
     And sweet is the far away.

     'Tis hard to be sick, but worse
     To have to sit by and nurse,
     For that is single, but this is double,
     The mind in pain, and the hands in trouble.
     The life men live is a weary coil,
     There is no rest from woe and toil;
     And if there's aught elsewhere more dear
     Than drawing breath as we do here,
     That darkness holds
     In black inextricable folds.

     Lovesick it seems are we
     Of this, whate'er it be,
     That gleams upon the earth;
     Because that second birth,
     That other life no man hath tried.

     What lies below
     No god will show,
     And we to whom the truth's denied
     Drift upon idle fables to and fro.

     Down swoops the breeze on the bough,

     The tree is caught, the boat dreads nought,
     Sheltered and safe below;
     The bank is high, and the wind runs by,
     Giving us leave to row.

     The bank was dipping low and lower,
     Showing the glowing west,
     The oar went slower, for either rower
     The river was heaving her breast.

     That sunset seemed to my dauntless steerer
     The lifting and breaking of day,
     That flush on the wave to me was dearer
     Than shade on a windless way.

<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Across three shires I stretch and lean,
     To gaze beyond the hills that screen
     The trustful eyes and gracious mien
     Of unforgotten Geraldine.

     Up Severn sea my fancy leadeth,
     And past the springs of Thames it speedeth,
     On to the brilliant town, which needeth,
     Far less than I, the laugh of Edith.

     Sad gales have changed my woodland scene
     To russet-brown from gold and green;
     Cold and forlorn like me hath been
     The boat that carried Geraldine.

     On silent paths the whistler weedeth,
     And what his tune is no one heedeth;
     On hay beneath the linhay feedeth
     The ass that felt the hand of Edith.

     Oh cherished thought of Geraldine,
     I'd rhyme till summer, if the Queen
     Would blow her trumpets and proclaim
     Fresh rhymes for that heroic name.

     Oh babbler gay as river stickle,
     Next year you'll be too old to tickle;
     But while my Torridge flows I'll say
     "Blithe Edith liked me half day."

<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Oh, scanty white garment! they ask why I wear you,
     Such thin chilly vesture for one that is frail,
     And dull words of prose cannot truly declare you
     To be what I bid you be, love's coat of mail.

     You were but a symbol of cleanness and rest,
     To don in the summer time, three years ago;
     And now you encompass a care-stricken breast
     With fabric of fancy to keep it aglow.

     For when it was Lammastide two before this,
     When freshening my face after freshening my lilies,
     A door opened quickly, and down fell a kiss,
     The lips unforeseen were my passionate Willie's.

     My Willie was travel-worn, Willie was cold,
     And I might not keep but a dear lock of hair.
     I clad him in silk and I decked him with gold,
     But welcome and fondness were choked in despair.

     I follow the wheels, and he turns with a sob,
     We fold our mute hands on the death of the hour;
     For heart-breaking virtues and destinies rob
     The soul of her nursling, the thorn of her flower.

     The lad's mind is rooted, his passion red-fruited,
     The head I caressed is another's delight;
     And I, though I stray through the year sorrow-suited,
     At Lammas, for Willie's sake, robe me in white.

    <h2>
      TO TWO YOUNG LADIES
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     There are, I've read, two troops of years,
     One troop is called the teens;
     They bring sweet gifts to little dears,
     Ediths and Geraldines.

     The others have no certain name,
     Though children of the sun,
     They come to wrinkled men, and claim
     Their treasures one by one.

     There is a hermit faint and dry,
     In things called rhymes he dabbles,
     And seventeen months have heard him sigh
     For Cissy and for Babbles.

     Once, when he seemed to be bedridden,
     These girls said, "Make us lines,"
     He tried to court, as he was bidden,
     His vanished Valentines.

     Now, three days late, yet ere they ask,
     He's meekly undertaken
     To do his sentimental task,
     Philandering, though forsaken.

     I pace my paradise, and long
     To show it off to Peris;
     They come not, but it can't be wrong
     To raise their ghosts by queries.

     Is Geraldine in flowing robes?
     Has Edith rippling curls?
     And do their ears prolong the lobes
     Weighed down with gold and pearls?

     And do they know the verbs of France?
     And do they play duetts?
     And do they blush when led to dance?
     And are they called coquettes?

     Oh, Cissy, if the heartless year
     Sets our brief loves asunder!
     Oh, Babbles, whom I daren't call dear!
     What can I do but wonder?

     I wonder what you're both become,
     Whether you're children still;
     I pause with fingers twain and thumb
     Closed on my faltering quill;

     I pause to think how I decay,
     And you win grace from Time.
     Perhaps ill-natured folks would say
     He's pausing for a rhyme.

     The sun, who drew us far apart,
     Might lessen my regrets,
     Would he but deign to use his art
     In painting your vignettes.

     Then though I groaned for losing half
     Of joys that memory traces,
     I could forego the talk, the laugh,
     In welcoming the faces.

<pre xml:space="preserve">
     The strawberry tree and the crimson thorn,
     And Fanny's myrtle and William's vine,
     And honey of bountiful jessamine,
     Are gone from the homestead where I was born.

     I gaze from my Grandfather's terrace wall,
     And then I bethink me how once I stept
     Through rooms where my Mother had blest me,
     and wept
     To yield them to strangers, and part with them all.

     My Father, like Matthew the publican, ceased
     Full early from hoarding with stainless mind,
     To Torrington only and home inclined,
     Where brotherhood, cousinhood, graced his feast.

     I meet his remembrance in market lane,
     'Neath town-hall pillars and churchyard limes,
     In streets where he tried a thousand times
     To chasten anger and soften pain.

     Ah I would there were some one that I could aid,
     Though lacking the simpleness, lacking the worth,
     Yet wanted and trusted by right of birth,
     Some townfellow stripling, some Torrington maid.

     Oh pitiful waste! oh stubborn neglect!
     Oh pieties smothered for thirty years!
     Oh gleanings of kindness in dreams and tears!
     Oh drift cast up from a manhood wrecked!

     There's one merry maiden hath carelessly crossed
     The threshold I dread, and she never discerns
     In keepsakes she thanks me for, lessons she learns,
     A sign of the grace that I squandered and lost.

     My birthplace to Meg is but window and stone,
     My knowledge a wilderness where she can stray,
     To keep what she gathers or throw it away;
     So Meg lets me laugh with her, mourning alone.

      A SICK FRENCH POET'S ENGLISH FRIENDS
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     When apple buds began to swell,
     And Procne called for Philomel,
     Down there, where Seine caresseth sea
     Two lassies deigned, or chanced, to be
     Playmates or votaries for me,
     Miss Euphrasie, Miss Eulalie.

     Then dates of birth dropt out of mind,
     For one was brave as two were kind;
     In cheerful vigil one designed
     A maze of wit for two to wind;
     And that grey Muse who served the three
     Broke daylight into reverie.

     Peace lit upon a fluttering vein,
     And, self forgetting, on the brain,
     On rifts, by passion wrought, again
     Splashed from the sky of childhood rain;
     And rid of afterthought were we,
     And from foreboding sweetly free.

     Now falls the apple, bleeds the vine,
     And moved by some autumnal sign,
     I, who in spring was glad, repine,
     And ache without my anodyne.
     Oh things that were, oh things that are,
     Oh setting of my double star!

     This day this way an Iris came,
     And brought a scroll, and showed a name.
     Now surely they who thus reclaim
     Acquaintance should relight a flame.
     So speed, gay steed, that I may see
     Dear Euphrasie, dear Eulalie.

     Behind this ivy screen are they
     Whose girlhood flowered on me last May.
     The world is lord of all; I pray
     They be not courtly&mdash;who can say?
     Well, well, remembrance held in fee
     Is good, nay, best. I turn and flee.

     Stands lifting her eyes to the whitening slope,
     And longs for her laddies at suppertime soon.

     The laddies, the dog, and the witless sheep,
     Are bound to come home, for the snow will be deep.
     The mother is pickling a scornful word
     To throw at the head of the elder lad, Hugh;
     But talkative Jamie, as gay as a bird,
     Will have nothing beaten save snow from his shoe.
     He has fire in his eyes, he has curls on his head,
     And a silver brooch and a kerchief red.

     Poor Hugh, trudging on with his collie pup Jess,
     Has kept his plain mind to himself all the way,
     Just quietly giving his dog the caress
     Which no one gave him for a year and a day.
     And luckily quadrupeds seldom despise
     Our lumbering wits and our lack-lustre eyes.

     Deep down in the corrie, high up on the brae,
     Where Shinnel and Scar tumble down from the rock
     The wicked white ladies have been at their play,
     The wind has been pushing the leewardly flock.
     The white land should tell where the creatures are gone,
     But snow hides the snow that their hooves have been on.

     Ah! down there in Urchinhope nobody knows
     How blinding the flakes, and the north wind how cruel.
     Euphemia's gudeman will come for his brose,
     But far up the hill is her darling, her jewel.
     She sees something crimson. "Oh, gudeman, look up!
     There's Jamie's cravat on the neck of the pup."

     "Where, where have ye been, Jess, and where did ye
     leave him?
     Now just get a bite, pup, then show me my pet.
     Poor Jamie 'll be tired, and the sleep will deceive him;
     Oh, stir him, oh, guide him, before the sun set!"
     "Quick, Jock, bring a lantern! quick, Sandie, some
     wraps!
     Before ye win till him 'twill darken, perhaps."

     Jess whimpered; the young moon was down in the
     west;
     A shelter-stone jutted from under the hill;
     Stiff hands beneath Jamie's blue bonnet were pressed,
     And over his beating heart one that was still.
     Bareheaded and coatless, to windward lay Hugh,
     And high on his back the snow gathered and grew.

     "Now fold them in plaids, they'll be up with the sun;
     Their bed will be warm, and the blood is so strong.
     How wise to send Jessie; now cannily run.
     Poor pup, are ye tired? we'll be home before long."
     Jess licked a cold cheek, and the bonny boy spoke:
     "Where's Hugh?" The pup whimpered, but Hugh
     never woke.

      A SOLDIER'S MIRACLE
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     'Twas when we learnt we could be beat;
     Our star misled us, and' we strayed.
     Elsewhere the host was in retreat;
     We were a guideless lost brigade.

     We stumbled on a town in doubt,
     To halt and sup we were full fain,
     The man that held the chart cried out,
     "'Tis Vaucouleurs in old Lorraine."

     In Vaucouleurs we will not doubt,
     For here, when need was sore, Saint Jane
     Arose, and girt herself to rout
     The foes that troubled her Lorraine.

     So here we feast in faith to-night,
     To-morrow we'll rejoin the host
     Drink, drink! the wine is pure and bright,
     And Jane our maiden is the toast.

     But I, that faced the window, caught
     A passing cloud, a foreign plume,
     A Prussian helmet; and the thought
     Of peril chilled the tavern room.

     We rose, we glared through twilight panes,
     We muttered curses bosom-deep;
     A tell-tale gallop scared the lanes,
     We grudged to spoil our comrades' sleep.

     Then louder than the Uhlan's hoof
     Fell storm from sky and flood on banks,
     September's passion smote the roof;
     We blest it, and to Jane gave thanks.

     Betwixt us and that Uhlan's mates
     A bridgless river strongly flowed.
     A sign was shown that checked the fates,
     And on that storm our maiden rode.

    <h2>
      A BALLAD FOR A BOY
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     When George the Third was reigning a hundred
     years ago,
     He ordered Captain Farmer to chase the foreign foe.
     "You're not afraid of shot," said he, "you're not
     afraid of wreck,
     So cruise about the west of France in the frigate
     called <i>Quebec</i>.

     Quebec was once a Frenchman's town, but twenty
     years ago
     King George the Second sent a man called General
     Wolfe, you know,
     To clamber up a precipice and look into Quebec,
     As you'd look down a hatchway when standing on
     the deck.

     If Wolfe could beat the Frenchmen then so you can
     beat them now.
     Before he got inside the town he died, I must allow.
     But since the town was won for us it is a lucky name,
     And you'll remember Wolfe's good work, and you
     shall do the same."

     Then Farmer said, "I'll try, sir," and Farmer bowed
     so low
     That George could see his pigtail tied in a velvet bow.
     George gave him his commission, and that it might be
     safer,
     Signed "King of Britain, King of France," and sealed
     it with a wafer.

     Then proud was Captain Farmer in a frigate of his
     own,
     And grander on his quarter-deck than George upon
     his throne.
     He'd two guns in his cabin, and on the spar-deck ten,
     And twenty on the gun-deck, and more than ten score
     men.

     And as a huntsman scours the brakes with sixteen
     brace of dogs,
     With two-and-thirty cannon the ship explored the fogs.
     From Cape la Hogue to Ushant, from Rochefort to
     Belleisle,
     She hunted game till reef and mud were rubbing on
     her keel.

     The fogs are dried, the frigate's side is bright with
     melting tar,
     The lad up in the foretop sees square white sails afar;
     The east wind drives three square-sailed masts from
     out the Breton bay,
     And "Clear for action!" Farmer shouts, and reefers
     yell "Hooray!"

     The Frenchmen's captain had a name I wish I could
     pronounce;
     A Breton gentleman was he, and wholly free from
     bounce,
     One like those famous fellows who died by guillotine
     For honour and the fleurs-de-lys, and Antoinette the
     Queen.

     The Catholic for Louis, the Protestant for George,
     Each captain drew as bright a sword as saintly smiths
     could forge;
     And both were simple seamen, but both could under-
     stand
     How each was bound to win or die for flag and native
     land.

     The French ship was <i>La Surveillante</i>, which means
     the watchful maid;
     She folded up her head-dress and began to cannonade.
     Her hull was clean, and ours was foul; we had to
     spread more sail.
     On canvas, stays, and topsail yards her bullets came
     like hail.

     Sore smitten were both captains, and many lads beside,
     And still to cut our rigging the foreign gunners tried.
     A sail-clad spar came flapping down athwart a blazing
     gun;
     We could not quench the rushing flames, and so the
     Frenchman won.

     Our quarter-deck was crowded, the waist was all
     aglow;
     Men clung upon the taffrail half scorched, but loth
     to go;
     Our captain sat where once he stood, and would not
     quit his chair.
     He bade his comrades leap for life, and leave him
     bleeding there.

     The guns were hushed on either side, the Frenchmen
     lowered boats,
     They flung us planks and hencoops, and everything
     that floats.
     They risked their lives, good fellows! to bring their
     rivals aid.
     'Twas by the conflagration the peace was strangely
     made.

     <i>La Surveillante</i> was like a sieve; the victors had no rest.
     They had to dodge the east wind to reach the port of
     Brest.
     And where the waves leapt lower and the riddled ship
     went slower,
     In triumph, yet in funeral guise, came fisher-boats to
     tow her.

     They dealt with us as brethren, they mourned for
     Farmer dead;
     And as the wounded captives passed each Breton
     bowed the head.
     Then spoke the French Lieutenant, "'Twas fire that
     won, not we.
     You never struck your flag to us; you'll go to
     England free."

     'Twas the sixth day of October, seventeen hundred
     seventy-nine,
     A year when nations ventured against us to combine,
     <i>Quebec</i> was burnt and Farmer slain, by us remem-
     bered not;
     But thanks be to the French book wherein they're
     not forgot.

     Now you, if you've to fight the French, my youngster,
     bear in mind
     Those seamen of King Louis so chivalrous and kind;
     Think of the Breton gentlemen who took our lads to
     Brest,
     And treat some rescued Breton as a comrade and a
     guest.

     May the foemen's wives, the foemen's children,
     Feel the kid leaping when he lifts the surge,
     Tumult of swart sea, and the reefs that shudder
     Under the scourge.

     On such a day to the false bull Europa
     Trusted her snowy limbs; and courage failed her,
     Where the whales swarmed, the terror of sea-change
     and
     Treason assailed her.

     For the meadow-fays had she duly laboured,
     Eager for flowers to bind at eventide;
     Shimmering night revealed the stars, the billows,
     Nothing beside.

     Brought to Crete, the realm of a hundred cities,
     "Oh, my sire! my duty!" she clamoured sadly.
     "Oh, the forfeit! and oh, the girl unfathered,
     Wilfully, madly!

     What shore is this, and what have I left behind me?
     When a maid sins 'tis not enough to die.
     Am I awake? or through the ivory gateway
     Cometh a lie?

     Cometh a hollow fantasy to the guiltless?
     Am I in dreamland? Was it best to wander
     Through the long waves, or better far to gather
     Rosebuds out yonder?

     Now, were he driven within the reach of anger,
     Steel would I point against the villain steer,
     Grappling, rending the horns of the bull, the monster
     Lately so dear.

     Shameless I left the homestead and the worship,
     Shameless, 'fore hell's mouth, wide agape, I pause.
     Hear me, some god, and set me among the lions
     Stript for their jaws.

     Ere on the cheek that is so fair to look on
     Swoop the grim fiends of hunger and decay,
     Tigers shall spring and raven, ere the sweetness
     Wither away.

     Worthless Europa! cries the severed father,
     Why dost thou loiter, cling to life, and doat?
     Hang on this rowan; hast thou not thy girdle
     Meet for thy throat?

     Lo, the cliff, the precipice, edged for cleaving,
     Trust the quick wind, or take a leman's doom.
     Live on and spin; thou wast a prince's daughter;
     Toil at the loom.

     Pass beneath the hand of a foreign lady;
     Serve a proud rival." Lo, behind her back
     Slyly laughed Venus, and her archer minion
     Held the bow slack.

     Then, the game played out, "Put away," she whispered,
     "Wrath and upbraiding, and the quarrel's heat,
     When the loathed bull surrenders horns, for riving,
     Low at your feet.

     Bride of high Jove's majesty, bride unwitting,

     The round world must be right;

     When Gladstone, bluest of the blue,
     Read all Augustine's folios through;
     When France was tame, and no one knew
     We and the Czar would fight.

     "Sixty years since" (said dear old Scott;
     We're bound, you know, to quote Sir Wat)
     This isle had not a sweeter spot
     Than Neville's Court by Granta;

     No Newnham then, no kirtled scribes,
     No Clelia to harangue the tribes,
     No race for girls, no apple bribes
     To tempt an Atalanta.

     We males talked fast, we meant to be
     World-betterers all at twenty-three,
     But somehow failed to level thee,
     Oh battered fort of Edom!

     Into the breach our daughters press,
     Brave patriots in unwarlike dress,
     Adepts at thought-in-idleness,
     Sweet devotees of freedom.

     And now it is your turn, fair soul,
     To see the fervent car-wheels roll,
     Your rivals clashing past the goal,
     Some sly Milanion leading.

     Ah! with them may your Genius bring
     Some Celia, some Miss Mannering;
     For youthful friendship is a thing
     More precious than succeeding.

      A LEGEND OF PORTO SANTO
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     A time-worn sage without a home,
     A man of dim and tearful sight,
     Up from the hallowed haven clomb
     In lowly longing for the height.

     He loiters on a half-way rock
     To hear the waves that pant and seethe,
     Which give the beats of Nature's clock
     To mortals conscious that they breathe.

     The buxom waves may nurse a boat,
     May well nigh seem to soothe and lull
     The crying of a tethered goat,
     The trouble of a searching gull.

     There might be comfort in the tide,
     There might be LethÃ¨ in the surge,
     Could they but hint that oceans hide,
     That pangs absolve, bereavements purge.

     The thinker, not despairing yet,
     Upraises limbs not wholly stiff,
     Half envying him that draws the net,
     Half proud to combat with the cliff.

     He groans, but soon around his lips
     Tear-channels bend into a smile,
     He thinks "They're saying in the ships
     I'm looking for the hidden isle.

     I climb but as my humours lead,
     My thoughts are mazed, my will is faint,
     Yon men who see me roam, they need
     No LethÃ¨-fount, no shriving saint."

     Good faith! can we believe, or feign
     Believing, that such lands exist
     Through ages drenched with blotting rain,
     For ever folded in the mist?

     Maybe some babe by sirens clothed
     Swam thence, and brought report thereof.
     Some hopeful virgin just betrothed
     Braved the incredulous pilot's scoff;

     And murmuring to a friendly lute,
     While greybeards snored and beldames laughed,
     Some minstrel-corsair made pursuit
     Along the moon's white hunting-shaft;

     Along the straight illumined track
     The bride, the singer, and the child
     Fled, far from sceptics, came not back,
     Engulped? Who knows? perhaps enisled.

     Now were there such another crew,
     Now would their bark make room for me,
     Now were that island false or true,
     I'd go, forgetting, with the three.

      THE SWIMMER'S WISH

<pre xml:space="preserve">
     ("Ionica," 1858, p. 81)

     Fresh from the summer wave, under the beech,
     Looking through leaves with a far-darting eye,
     Tossing those river-pearled locks about,
     Throwing those delicate limbs straight out,
     Chiding the clouds as they sailed out of reach,
     Murmured the swimmer, I wish I could fly.

     Laugh, if you like, at the bold reply,
     Answer disdainfully, flouting my words:
     How should the listener at simple sixteen
     Guess what a foolish old rhymer could mean
     Calmly predicting, "You will surely fly"&mdash;
     Fish one might vie with, but how be like birds?

     Sweet maiden-fancies, at present they range
     Close to a sister's engarlanded brows,
     Over the diamonds a mother will wear,
     In the false flowers to be shaped for her hair.&mdash;
     Slow glide the hours to thee, late be the change,
     Long be thy rest 'neath the cool beechen boughs!

     Genius and love will uplift thee: not yet,
     Walk through some passionless years by my side,
     Chasing the silly sheep, snapping the lily stalk,
     Drawing my secrets forth, witching my soul with talk.
     When the sap stays, and the blossom is set,
     Others will take the fruit, I shall have died.

      The following little Greek lyric occurs in a letter of December 18, 1862,
      to the Rev. E. D. Stone. "My lines," wrote William Johnson, "are suggested
      by the death of Thorwaldsen: he died at the age of seventy, imperceptibly,
      having fallen asleep at a concert. But when I had done them, I remembered
      Provost Hawtrey's last appearance in public at a music party, where he
      fell asleep: and so I value my lines as a bit of honour done to him, and
      it seems odd that I should unintentionally have caught in the second and
      third lines his characteristic sympathy with the young...."
